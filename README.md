# Python Internship Projects On CODSOFT

This repository contains three Python projects developed during my internship. They include a calculator, a password generator, and a todo list application.

### Calculator

- Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Handles both integer and floating-point numbers.
- Includes a simple command-line interface.

### Password Generator

- Generates strong passwords of customizable length.
- Allows users to specify character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters).
- Outputs passwords to the command line or saves them to a file.

### Todo List

- Manages a list of tasks with operations like adding, marking as done, and deleting tasks.
- Stores tasks persistently using file storage.
- Supports basic command-line interface operations.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: None additional beyond standard library
